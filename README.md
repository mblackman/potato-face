# potato-face

Potato Face is a 2D game engine that I built as part of Pikuma's 2D game engine class.

This engine utilizes:

- GLM: <https://github.com/g-truc/glm>
- ImGui: <https://github.com/ocornut/imgui>
- Lua5.3: <https://www.lua.org/>
- SDL2: <https://www.libsdl.org/>
- spdlog: <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>

## Ubuntu Setup

Run this command to install the necessary library and tools:

``` bash
sudo apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev liblua5.3-dev lua5.3 libspdlog-dev
```
